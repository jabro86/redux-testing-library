Simple and maintainable tests for your react/redux application inspired by [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/).

- write simple and reliable integration tests
- dispatch actions, wait for store changes and assert the result
- do not test implementation details: just rely on actions and selectors
- includes the full power of react-testing-library (no other dependencies)
